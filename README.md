- 🌱 I’m currently learning ruby.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who might be able to give me advice or tips. I've only been at this for a week so im pretty new.
- 📫 email me at jonahisolda@gmail.com
- im very much new to coding and github so i'm not entirely sure what im able to do here, please feel free to message me if you have time to maybe tutor me on some beginners problems. I'm just learning enumerables, nested loops, and hashes.
